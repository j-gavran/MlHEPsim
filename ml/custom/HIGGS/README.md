# [HIGGS dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/280/higgs)
The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 21 features (columns 2-22) are kinematic properties measured by 
the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last seven features are functions of the first 21 features; these are 
high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. 

This is a binary classification problem dataset. The class label y âˆˆ {1, 0} is whether the signal was found in the event or not.
